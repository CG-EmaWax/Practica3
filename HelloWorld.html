<b>I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms
No, don't hit my line, babygirl, like, who are you?
I've been tripping off the tabs in my room
I don't know why, baby, but I'm feeling blue
Take another tab, an ounce of the shrooms

<i>Oh no, don't hate just get up out my way
I've been getting high like every single day
And I need some peace of mind
I don't know where to find
All the the answers to my questions, I'm not satisfied
Where my mind is at, Hell is bound to find me
And if I find the light, that shit is gonna blind me
I've been off it like a prophet, ain't no telling why
Lately, can you blame me for the fact that I just lost my mind?</i>

<del>And if you need me, then you know where to find me
I'm feeling lost, I just need someone to guide me
Don't wanna feel left out
Please, understand me now
But If you can't, then it's alright, I'll always be around</del>
